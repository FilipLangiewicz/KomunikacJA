# Project ME (Projekt JA)

Personal data visualization performed as a project task for Data Visualization Techniques course in the second year of Data Science studies at the Warsaw University of Technology. Authors: [@FilipLangiewicz](https://github.com/FilipLangiewicz), [@ZosiaKaminska](https://github.com/kaminskaz) and [@AnnaOstrowska](https://github.com/annaostrowska03).

The aim of the project was to prepare an interactive dashboard/website about ME: visualizing the authors' activity through the prism of the Internet of Things (data from: Facebook, Google, YT, mail, wearables, bank, Spotify, Uber, etc.).

We downloaded data from platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, then analyzed it and created interactive visualizations using the plotly package (mainly). The result of our work is the "KomunikacJA" application: [@KomunikacJA](https://github.com/FilipLangiewicz/Projekt_TWD_02/tree/main/app/KomunikacJA).
